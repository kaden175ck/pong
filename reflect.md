# Pong Game Reflection

## Lessons Learned

- Practiced using the DOM to move game elements in real time.
- Improved my CSS skills to make the game look good without needing the `<canvas>` tag. Learned some new CSS techniques too.
- Got better at JavaScript, figuring out game actions like the loop, responding to players, and when the ball hits the paddle or scores.
- Realized that having a clear plan from the start is very important because it can save a lot of time.

## Challenges Faced

- Every time I pressed the up or down keys, the window moved too, making the game hard to play.
- Spent a lot of time on coding issues, particularly with CSS and JavaScript.
- Fine-tuning the paddle movement and gameplay smoothness took trial and error, especially figuring out the scoring system.
- Developing the AI opponent was hard, and there was a point where the AI paddle didn't stay within the game area.
- The lack of initial planning meant redoing parts of the code to add features, which made refactoring and reviewing the workflow difficult.


## Handling Complexity

- Broke the project into smaller pieces, like paddle and ball movements, which made managing the code easier.
- Kept my code organized and used console logs to check on things, helping a lot with debugging.
- Learned to use browser developer tools like Chrome's Inspect (F12) to watch what happens in the game in real time.
- Started with a basic version of the game and then improved it step by step, fixing problems as they came up.

## Expectations Versus Outcome

- The finished game was different from what I initially imagined. Some parts didn't work out, and I think some areas could be improved.
- Put a lot of effort into making the gameplay enjoyable, which meant a lot of tweaking.
- The game's appearance ended up being better than I first expected, which makes the game more fun to play.

## Using AI Assistance

- Having AI for coding help was useful, especially for checking code quickly and making tweaks.
- ChatGPT was like having a quick reference for coding issues; it showed me how to do things like make a CSS glow or hide elements in JavaScript. I used to check Stack Overflow or documentation, but with ChatGPT, I could just ask questions and get answers right away.
