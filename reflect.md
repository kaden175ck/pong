# Reflection on Pong Game Implementation

- **Learning Points**:
  - Gained a deeper understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it using JavaScript to dynamically control game elements.
  - Enhanced knowledge of CSS for styling and animations, learning to create a visually appealing user interface without canvas.
  - Improved JavaScript proficiency, especially in understanding game loops, event handling, and collision detection algorithms, JS sytns of course.

- **Challenges**:
  - Balancing user control responsiveness while maintaining a performant game loop was a demanding task, I had many problem when I try to set the score limit.
  - Implementing AI is also a challenging part, one point I implement the AI, but the AI paddle moving our of bounds.

- **Managing Complexity**:
  - Broke down the game into smaller, manageable components (e.g., paddle movement, ball physics) to simplify the development process.
  - Used clear and modular functions to isolate different parts of the game logic, making debugging easier.
  - Applied incremental development, starting with a basic playable model and progressively adding features and refinements.

- **Final Product vs. Initial Design**:
  - The final product aligns well with the initial design goals but includes several improvements and refinements discovered during the implementation process.
  - Adaptability and user experience were greatly enhanced through iterative testing and feedback.
  - Visual effects and game dynamics were polished beyond the initial scope to enhance playability and aesthetic appeal.

- **Reflection on AI Assistance**:
  - AI assistance expedited the development process, particularly for syntactical guidance and styling effects.
  - Used AI akin to a "coding dictionary" to quickly retrieve information and examples, such as implementing a Glow Effect in CSS at line 294 and Hide the dropdown content after a brief delay in JS file at line 183.

- **Key Insights**:
  - Recognized the value of an iterative approach, allowing for continuous improvement and integration of innovative features throughout the development cycle.
