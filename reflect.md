# Reflection on Pong Game Implementation

- **Utilization of AI as a Resource**: 
  - Used AI akin to a "coding dictionary" to quickly retrieve information and examples, such as implementing a Glow Effect in CSS, saving significant time that would have been spent on manual searches.

- **Learning Points**:
  - Gained a deeper understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it using JavaScript to dynamically control game elements.
  - Enhanced knowledge of CSS for styling and animations, learning to create a visually appealing user interface without canvas.
  - Improved JavaScript proficiency, especially in understanding game loops, event handling, and collision detection algorithms.

- **Challenges**:
  - Managing the non-canvas limitation required innovative approaches to animation and element positioning.
  - Balancing user control responsiveness while maintaining a performant game loop was a demanding task.
  - Implementing a convincing and adaptable AI for the game without overwhelming the player.

- **Managing Complexity**:
  - Broke down the game into smaller, manageable components (e.g., paddle movement, ball physics) to simplify the development process.
  - Used clear and modular functions to isolate different parts of the game logic, making debugging easier.
  - Applied incremental development, starting with a basic playable model and progressively adding features and refinements.

- **Final Product vs. Initial Design**:
  - The final product aligns well with the initial design goals but includes several improvements and refinements discovered during the implementation process.
  - Adaptability and user experience were greatly enhanced through iterative testing and feedback.
  - Visual effects and game dynamics were polished beyond the initial scope to enhance playability and aesthetic appeal.

- **Reflection on AI Assistance**:
  - AI assistance expedited the development process, particularly for syntactical guidance and styling effects.
  - Relied on AI suggestions to optimize code efficiency and implement best practices.
  - Acknowledged the necessity to critically evaluate AI-generated code to ensure it fits the context of the game's unique logic and flow.

- **Key Insights**:
  - AI tools can significantly speed up the development process but they require a discerning eye to ensure the code remains clean, efficient, and tailored to the application.
  - The importance of user interface design and its impact on the overall gaming experience was emphasized.
  - Recognized the value of an iterative approach, allowing for continuous improvement and integration of innovative features throughout the development cycle.





Reflect on the implementation process using point form. Focus on what you learned, your challenges, how you managed the game's complexity, and how the final product compares to your initial design. If you used an AI to help write code, reflect on this process and highlight key insights you learned. If you chose not to use AI, explain why you did not need to or want to use it.


10: Excellent - Provides a comprehensive and detailed description of the process, demonstrates deep insight into challenges and decision-making
8: Good - Offers a thorough description of most parts of the process, shows good insight and self-awareness, though some areas might lack depth or detail.
