# Reflection on Building the Pong Game

## What I Learned

- Got hands-on experience with the DOM, which was essential for moving elements on the screen in real-time.
- Leveled up my CSS skills to create cool visual effects and a sleek interface, all without relying on the `<canvas>` element.
- Sharpened my JavaScript abilities, especially in crafting the core gameplay mechanics like the game loop, responding to user inputs, and figuring out when the ball hits the paddle or scores.

## Stumbling Blocks

- Getting the right mix between responsive paddle controls and smooth gameplay took some trial and error; setting up the score limit was particularly tricky.
- Building the AI opponent was tough. At one point, after I thought I had it nailed, the AI paddle decided to go rogue and leave the playfield.

## Tackling Complexity

- I tackled the project by breaking it into chunks, like handling paddle and ball movement, which made the code more manageable.
- I kept my code neat and organized into functions, which really paid off when I had to troubleshoot.
- I started with a simple version of the game and then built on it, refining features and squashing bugs along the way.

## Expectations vs. Reality

- The game I ended up with was true to my vision but ended up being even cooler with the extra bells and whistles I added along the way.
- I put a lot of effort into making the game feel good to play, which meant lots of tweaking based on playing it over and over.
- The look of the game got a significant upgrade from what I first pictured, making the whole experience way more engaging.

## Working with AI

- Having AI as a coding buddy was a game-changer, especially for quick syntax checks and style tweaks.
- It was like having a coding encyclopedia at my fingertips; I could pull up how to create a CSS glow effect or hide a dropdown in JS without missing a beat.
